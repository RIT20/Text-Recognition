# Text-Recognition
Ongoing self employed project.
In this project , i have been planning to extract various helpful details on vehicle that are violating the traffic laws.

I  have used pre-trained model on open cv to detect the text in the image.
Then, i used pytesseract to recognise the text
scope: cleaning of image necessary before running the model over it.
cleaning of image requires controlling contrast, enhancing the image , image brightness, gray-scaling the image
