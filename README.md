# Text-Recognition
Ongoing self employed project
I  have used pre-trained model on open cv to detect the text in the image.
Then, i used pytesseract to recognise the text 
scope: cleaning of image necessary before running the model over it.
cleaning of image requires contrast, enhancing , image brightness, gray-scaling the image
